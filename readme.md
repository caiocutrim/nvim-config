## My nvim config directory
Here we have some files which contains configuration of neovim.
That is pretty userful if you want to use these files and save time not by configuring things from scratch.
## Usage
Clone this repo and put in .config directory which is inside your home directory (if you are in ubuntu and macosX)
That is all folks.
